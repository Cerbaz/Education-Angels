      <li class=project>About my project</li>
    <p2>The seeds of this project were sowned to support the education of children who were out of school during the pandemic. <br>
      The first idea was to give bilingual children the language skills they needed but couldn't develop with their monolingual parents. This project will create equal opportunities in education and will help children to develop their language, math, technology and science skills as well as to gain international friendships by meeting, learning and working together. <br>
    After this course, our main goal is to continue to develop our website in order to transform it to a social network for students and mentors to get connected and to work together by sharing their learnings in various areas.</p2>

      <li class=me>About me</li>
      <p1>Hello dear user, my name is Ceylin Erbaz and I am a 16 years old student from Turkey. I am currently enrolled in the French embassy school named Lycée Français Charles de Gaulle. First of all, welcome to my website.
        The fact that technology and science will spread goodness and a better education system to the world really excites me. I would like to give some informations about my journey with STEM:

I first met technology with Nintendo and Ipad when I was 8 years old. By the time I turned 8 years old, I got curious to learn more about how they worked. Unfortunately, back in 2011, there was nothing about early age computer science in Turkey. I had many innovative ideas about my future career: even though I wanted to learn computer science, I also developed an interest for medicine that’s why I did an internship at a hospital.

In January 2013, Code.org was founded and I started using it.  When I was in middle school, I wanted to learn Java that’s why I started using Carnegie Mellon University’s Alice software.
In October 27th I gave a speech about my computer science journey in Computer Science World in Asia 2019 at the University of Tokyo as the ambassador of Robincode.org. Right now, I’m coding with Python and learning the C language with Harvard’s CS50 course. I’m discovering neuroscience with EEG. I hope that I will be a successful neuroscientist and work for artificial intelligence for everybody. In my opinion everybody must learn the digital skills of the 21’st century in order to produce technology for a better world.

Currently, I am only 16 years old but I am well aware that I can shape the world with better STEM education. I also have other skills than STEM: I can speak four languages fluently: turkish, french, english and spanish. I am playing tennis, basketball and the piano.
